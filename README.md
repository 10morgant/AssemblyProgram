# AssemblyProgram
## Overview
AssemblyProgram is an emulator written for the AQA styled Assembly required for the course.
It is written in Java 8 using JavaFX for the visual interface.

It aims to make use of Object-Orientated Programming styles and techniques. This is a rewrite of a previous project, written for A-Level Coursework in this [repo](https://www.google.com). Warning the old version is not maintained and is almost defiantly riddled with bugs.
