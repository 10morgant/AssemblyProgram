# AssemblyProgram
## Overview
AssemblyProgram is an emulator written for the AQA styled Assembly required for the course.
It is written in Java 8 using JavaFX for the visual interface.

It allows the writing and "Execution" of code and displays it in a "Compiled form" in a "Memory viewer". These terms are used loosely as this is just an emulation and runs inside the actual program in more of an interpreted form. 

It aims to make use of Object-Orientated Programming styles and techniques. This is a rewrite of a previous project, written for A-Level Coursework in this [repo](https://github.com/10morgant/TimSim). Warning the old version is not maintained and is almost defiantly riddled with bugs.
